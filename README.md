# üì± Flutter Course Project
This repository contains the code that I developed during my Flutter course. The course covered the basic concepts and functionalities of Flutter, and this project includes all the required code to implement those concepts.

## üìã Overview
The project is a simple Flutter app that includes the following screens:

### üè† Home screen:
The home screen includes a welcome message and a button that navigates to the second screen.
### ‚úâÔ∏è Second screen:
The second screen includes a form that allows the user to input their name and email address. Once the user submits the form, the app navigates back to the home screen and displays a message that includes the user's name and email.
All the code that I developed for this project is located in the ```lib``` folder.

The project includes all the basic Flutter code required to build these screens, including:

### main.dart: 
The main entry point of the app.
### home_screen.dart: 
The code for the home screen.
### second_screen.dart: 
The code for the second screen.
### models/user.dart:
The model class for the user data.
### widgets/: 
A folder containing reusable widgets used in the app.
